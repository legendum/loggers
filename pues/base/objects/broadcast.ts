/**
 * `broadcastRow` — re-emit a row mutation that happened *outside*
 * `mountResource`'s routes, so `useResource` subscribers stay coherent
 * across mixed write surfaces.
 *
 * The canonical case is fifos' `/w/:ulid/*` webhook surface: it writes
 * the `items` table directly on push/pop/done/fail/skip/retry/pull,
 * bypassing pues' POST/PATCH/DELETE handlers and their built-in
 * broadcasts. Without a bridge, browser tabs subscribed to
 * `useResource("items")` would silently go stale on every webhook
 * mutation. With this helper, the webhook handler reads the canonical
 * wire row from the DB (via `toWire`) and calls `broadcastRow` so
 * subscribers see the same event shape they would get from a native
 * pues mutation.
 *
 * Scope (deliberately narrow):
 *   - `broadcastRow` covers `.created` and `.updated` — the two events
 *     that carry a full row.
 *   - `broadcastDelete` covers `.deleted` — payload is just `{ id }` or
 *     `{ id, parent_id }`, so it takes ids rather than a wire row.
 *   - Neither covers `.reordered` (different payload shape).
 *
 * See SPEC §7.4.
